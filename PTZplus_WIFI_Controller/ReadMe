 Version 7.00
  If you are updating from versions earlier than v7.0 You must update all parts of the system to Version 7.** to use this update.
Your nextion display must also be updated with v7.0 .tft file

 Update 7.0 April 2025
  1) Added a beta version of Auto Focus/zoom Limits which has the system establish the limits automaticly.
  Note this function is still in beta testing but shows promiss. If it does not work for you the previouse manual method is still available.
  In order to use the function the PTZplus WIFI controller must also be updated to version 7
  2)The system also know establishes a home position for both Focus and zoom (If available) on startup.
  3)Added a home position calibration tool accesable from the setup menu on the Nextion display. Since different batches of magnet and Reed switch
  demand differing offset values from the magnet this allows you to ensure your camera is level and the pan is alligned over the base correctly
  at startup.This tool will probably only ever be required to run once at the beginning of the heads life.

update 6.05 Fixed a bug where shutter speed was not being respected in time-lapse mode
update 6.04: Fixes a bug where Ease values were not being updated correctly
update 6.03 adds a new funtion "All To Pose" to the PTZ menu. This allows you to have all cameras move to the current pose/preset number at the same time with one button press.


There are three possible 2.8" Nextion displays that can be used by the system BASIC, DISCOVERY, ENHANCED
Thay can be identified from the colour of the PCB board on the display.
Blue-Basic
Orange-Discovery
Black- Enhanced

For our purposes they all work the same but the firmware requires you install for the specific model
hense the reason there are three Nextion files here. Install the correct one for your display by copying this file to a micro SD card.
Note: only one .tft file should be on the card. Somtimes it takes two attempts to update the software!
